# sonic_forces_splinetools
Blender plugin for editing Sonic Forces Splines

The plugin suport *.path and also support write and read directly in the pac files.
 If a pac archive is used, it will create a collection having the splines with the same name that the filename of the *.path in the pac file for each one. For exporting , it will export all splines to a file, or if you select an ar file it will create the spline files if the collection having the curves have a name ended in .path,(like is created when you import) 

I didÂ´t found a tool for blender and make this one. It edits the spline so the mesh of the rail still needs to be done but is not what this video is aiming
